        <h3>To my other half, </h3> 
        <p style="margin-bottom: 5px">
            I can't express how grateful I am for the amazing adventure we've had together. 
            Today marks an incredible chapter in our journey of being together. With each passing moment,
             all those kakulitans we made, fights that turns into misunderstandings na nareresolve natin agad 
             and all those moments that made me love you more, I'm amazed by how far our relationship has come. 
        </p> 
        <p style="margin-bottom: 5px">
            Remember those moments when we paved our way though happy times, laughing till our hearts burst 
            with joy and memories that remain like priceless artifacts? Those moments made our story more memorable 
            and guiding us along our journey together. We've had our share of disagreements and fights and I know 
            hindi talaga mawawala yun sa relationships yet they only served to reaffirm the passion that fuels our 
            connection. Even after our fights together we still chose to stay and correct our mistakes, lahat ng 
            napagaawayan natin serves as a lesson, I mean minsan hindi naman nasusunod but ayun nga we still manage to fix our problems. 
        </p> 
        <p style="margin-bottom: 5px">  
            I've discovered through the wild ride that is our path together that love is about accepting one other 
            for who we are, flaws and scars and allâ€”rather than just the happy times. I love you not only for who you are, 
            but also for the person you encourage me to become and the way you push me to develop daily so I can become a better person, 
            understand myself better, and love more deeply. I've found a haven in your arms, a place where love and acceptance are 
            unrestricted and where I may be understood without using words. You're the missing component that puts my puzzle together, 
            the rhythm to my song, and the colors to my canvas.
        </p> 
        <p style="margin-bottom: 5px">
            On this special day, as we celebrate our first year anniversary, know that you have my undying, unchanging, and unending love. 
        </p> 
        <p style="margin-bottom: 5px">   
            Happy Anniversary, my love.  Here's to many more years of love, laughter, and shared adventures. 
            You're my today, my tomorrow, and all the tomorrows yet to come.
